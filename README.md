# grunt-bom-removal

> A Byte Order Mark removal task for grunt.

## WARNING
As a note it does a direct rewrite of the file, just without the BOM, please make sure you have tested grunt-bom-removal before using it any code, just in case for some reason it decides to eat your code for lunch.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~1.0.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-bom-removal --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bom-removal');
```

*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 1.0.x. If you're still using an older version it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.4-to-1.0).*

## BOM task
_Run this task with the `grunt bom` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.

### Options

#### printMissed

  build: ["path/to/file/one.txt", "path/to/file/two.txt"],
  release: ["path/to/another/file/one.js", "path/to/another/file/two.js"]
},
```

#### Long (specific targets with per target options)
